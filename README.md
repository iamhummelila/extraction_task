# extraction_task

This code is based on an old exam question that I solved. Due to how big the data to-be-processed was, I wasn't actually able to try it out with the "real big data" yet, since I dont currently have the space necessary on my working computer.

If you manage to try the code out and it works, feel free to let me know. Of course, you may also let me know if it doesn't work. Please consider that within this exam, we were not allowed to use non-standard-libraries.
